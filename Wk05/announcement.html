Keep in mind:
- This week students will continue learning HTML and CSS by looking at font properties and padding. To prepare the class for this lesson, you may want to send out a class email giving a brief introduction to the subject matter as well as possible examples.
- Encourage the students to experiment this week...it is all about polish and details.
- Remind the students as well that by the end of the week they should have settled on an idea for their personal site. Next week they will start planning for that.
