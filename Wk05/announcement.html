Keep in mind:
- This week students will continue learning HTML and CSS by looking at font properties and padding. To prepare the class for this lesson, you may want to send out a class email giving a brief introduction to the subject matter as well as possible examples.
- Encourage the students to experiment this week...it is all about polish and details.
- Remind the students as well that by the end of the week they should have settled on an idea for their personal site. Next week they will start planning for that.

<!--How did last weeks assignment go?-->
<h2 style="color: #993366;">What to Expect This Week</h2>
<p>This week you will have another Khan Academy lesson and will add more CSS to your home page. Each week it's getting closer to the wireframe!</p>
<p>You will also have a required discussion board where you will get feedback on last weeks assignment.
  Even if you don't have much feedback to give these discussion boards are great because they give you a chance to learn by looking through other students code.</p>
<p>Remember at the beginning of the semester when I mentioned you would get to create a website about whatever you want towards the end of the semester?
  This week you're going to get started on planning for it! You will put together an elevator pitch and share it with a few others.
  You can share your elevator pitch to other students during office hours or your pathway gatherings.</p>
<p>Lastly, you will have a couple quizes and a survey. The quizes just confirm that you have done your work in the class. The survey is about me!
  Please give honest feedback so that I can improve as an instructor. It will help me if you share things that you like about my teaching style, things that you wish I did, and things you're maybe not a fan of.
  You will not hurt my feelings, I really want to know how to get better so that I can help more students.</p>

<h2 style="color: #993366;">Spiritual Thought</h2>
<p>"Work hard to achieve your dreams. Don’t let discouragement or mistakes delay you. Move outside your comfort zones. Push yourselves. Expect more. You can move beyond the limitations set by ordinary men. Don’t let the low standards and expectations of the world and others cause you to aim beneath your nobility and ability—dream big!"</p>
