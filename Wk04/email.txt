Hello!

Can you believe we are already in week 4? Time is flying by. After this week I'm going to stop sending weekly emails. Of course, I will still email as needed, but my hope is that you now know to check the announcements section every week to get the information that you need. I will continue to post announcements every week letting you know what to expect for the week and giving you videos to help out.

Again, I do want to remind you to get started as early in the week as possible. This gives you time to get help during office hours or in the tutoring center if you have a hard time with the assignments.

With that, I'm excited to get started this week!
