<h1 style="color: #993366;">Welcome to Week 4!</h1>
<p>I hope you guys had a really great weekend! My husband and I went paddle boarding on a small river behind our house.
  It was a really great time! We also celebrated Mother's day this year by facetiming with our moms. How was your weekend?</p>

<p>I wanted to say great work on last weeks home page assignment! You guys did really well on it.</p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">What to Expect This Week</h2>
<p>This week you are going to start adding some CSS to your home page. The CSS you add will help style the home page but it still won't look exactly like the wireframe.
  You'll also have a couple other activities and of course, a Khan Academy lesson. Are you enjoying the Khan Academy lessons? Let me know!</p>
<p>This week we have an optional questions and conversations discussion board as well as a required discussion board.</p>

<h2 style="color: #993366;">Office Hours</h2>
<p>I will hold office hours via zoom this Thursday at 7PM mountain time.
  Office hours will be recorded for anyone who canâ€™t attend and would like to watch later.
  Please come to office hours with questions in mind or work you would like to have reviewed.
  The link to my zoom room can be found in the 'resources' section of the course.</p>
<p>It's come to my attention that many of you have your gatherings on Thursdays when I hold office hours.
  Please comment below and let me know what would work better for you for future weeks.
  I am in young womens and we have been doing virtual activities on Wednesdays. I could possibly do 6PM (mountain time) on Wednesdays.
  Mondays and Tuesdays also work, I just worry that thats so early in the week that you guys won't have questions yet.
  We could also move to 6PM on Thursdays. Let me know your thoughts on this.</p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">Learning More + Tutorials to help you this week!</h2>
<h3>Code with Me: Adding More HTML and CSS</h3>
<p>I created a full-on tutorial about how to do this weeks assignment. It's super long (30 minutes!?!?).
  For that reason I recommend watching the video while you do the assignment. Go through the assignment with me and pause when you need to write your code.
  Optionally, you can also choose to only watch it if you are having a hard time with the assignment. It's up to you!</p>

<h3>CSS Cheatsheet</h3>
<p>This week is going to be challenging as you write CSS for the first time.
  I wanted to share this <a href="https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS Cheatsheet website</a> with you to help you out.
  There is a video on the website showing you how to use it.</p>
<p>Here are some more <a href="https://cssauthor.com/html-and-css-cheat-sheets/" target="_blank">HTML and CSS cheatsheets</a> that I found. Look through them and see if one will work for you!</p>

<h2 style="color: #993366;">Academic Honesty</h2>
<p>The work in this course is challenging, but I want to remind you to practice academic honesty.
  Many of you have friends or family taking this same course and it's essential that you do your own work.
  It's always great to work with friends, family, and peers, but copying or turning in somebody else's work as your own is wrong.
  Keep that in mind as we continue through the semester. Here's a link to the <a href="https://pathwaysupport.org/handbook/10-student-honor/honor-code/" target="_blank">pathway honor code</a> if you'd like to review it again!
