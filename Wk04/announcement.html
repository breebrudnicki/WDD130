<h2 style="color: #993366;">What to Expect This Week</h2>
<p>What are they doing this week?</p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">Getting Help and Feedback on Assignments</h2>
<h3 style="color: #993366;">Discussion Boards</h3>
<p>I have gone through the course and added a questions and conversations discussion board to every week of the course.
These discussion boards <b>are not required.</b> but can be used to ask and answer questions and even share things you've learned.
Please take some time to go through this board and see if you can help any of your peers who have asked questions.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Don't forget to include screenshots and code examples when asking for help.</p>
<p>If you post your website on this board, your peers can review it. If you post it by Thursday at 7 mountain time I will review it during office hours and give you some feedback.</p>
<h3 style="color: #993366;">Tutoring</h3>
<p>Tutoring is available for free through BYU-Idaho. If you are struggling with an assignment I recommend getting a tutor to help you.</p>
<p>You can visit this website to schedule a tutoring session:
