I hope you had a great weekend. This week you will be doing a few activities and you will also start working on the home page of your white water rafting website. Exciting!

I created a new announcement in the course that walks you through all the details and has some extra videos to help out as always. Be sure to check that out.

A few things to be aware of:

1. We will have office hours this week on Thursday at 7PM mountain time. Please come with any questions you have.
2. I try my best to grade assignments in a timely manner - most of the time within 24 hours. If you turn in an assignment early and don't get 100% I will give you some pointers so that you can resubmit by the deadline and get full points. Turn your work in early and take advantage of this!
3. Tutoring is available for those struggling with this class. There are more details about how to get a tutor in this weeks assignment.

Good luck this week! Again, don't forget to check out this weeks announcement which goes into a lot more detail.
