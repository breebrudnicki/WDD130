I hope you had a great weekend. This week you will be doing a few activities and you will also start working on the home page of your white water rafting website. Exciting!

I created a new announcement in the course that walks you through all the details. Be sure to check that out.

A few things to be aware of:

1. We will have office hours this week on Thursday at 7PM mountain time. Please come with any questions you have.
2. There is not a required discussion board this week. I did create a questions and conversations board for you to ask questions about assignments and answer your peers questions if you are able to. If you post your assignment there by Thursday at 7PM mountain time I will review your website during office hours and give you some feedback.
3. I try my best to grade assignments in a timely manner - most of the time within 24 hours. If you turn in an assignment early and don't get 100% I will give you some pointers so that you can resubmit by the deadline and get full points. Turn your work in early and take advantage of this!
4. Tutoring is available for those struggling with this class. There are more details about how to get a tutor in this weeks assignment.

Good luck this week! Again, don't forget to check out this weeks announcement which goes into a lot more detail.
