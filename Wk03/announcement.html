<p>Great work on your site plan assignments! Although we are all creating the same site, it was fun to see all of your different color schemes and font choices.
Each week I get more excited to see your final websites.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">As a reminder, you need to have passed last week's CSS quiz with 100% to be able to move on to this week.
  You can retake the quiz as many times as you need to get 100%. </p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">What to Expect This Week</h2>
<p>This week you will have another Khan Academy lesson and will learn about what it means to be a web designer.
  You will also be learning more about wireframes and how to troubleshoot your code.
  You will also have another activity this week to continue working on your white water rafting site.
  In this activity you are going to be writing the HTML for the home page by following the wireframe that was provided.
  There isn't as much guidance in the instructions as there was last week and you will be expected to write most of the HTML on your own.
  I know this sounds challenging but you are ready for it!</p>
<p>I want you to keep a few things in mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The assignment will make more sense if you refer to the wireframe while reading the instructions</li>
  <li>Your assignment will NOT look like the wireframe at the end of the assignment.
    If you watch the videos in the wireframing activity (please do) it shows a pretty good example of what your site will look like this week.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to complete the wireframing and troubleshooting activities. It's important you understand what is taught in those lessons.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="color: #993366;">Week 3 Walkthrough</h3>
<!--TODO: Redo!-->
<p>Below is a walkthrough of your week 3 assignments. Apologies, because it is a little long, but it goes into some details that will be helpful for you.
  At the end it also shows an example of what your week03 activity should look like at the end!</p>

<h2 style="color: #800080;">Office Hours</h2>
<p>I will hold office hours via zoom this Thursday at 7PM mountain time.
  Office hours will be recorded for anyone who can’t attend and would like to watch later.
  Please come to office hours with questions in mind or work you would like to have reviewed.
  The link to my zoom room can be found in the resources section of the course.
</p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">Grading and Late Work</h2>
<p>I do my best to grade assignments within a timely manner. <i>Most of the time</i> I grade your work within a day of you turning it in.
  If you turn in your work early and get less than 100% I try to tell you how to improve your work and allow you to resubmit <strong>by the deadline</strong> for full points.
  So if you turn your work in a little early, you have an advantage!
</p>
<p>Late work is only worth 1/2 points so be sure to get your work in on time. <strong>That includes re-submitted work.</strong></p>
<p>If you know you won't be able to get work in on time please contact me before you've missed the deadline or as soon as possible in the case of an emergency.
  We may be able to make special arrangements depending on the situation.</p>
