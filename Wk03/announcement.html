<h1 style="color: #993366;">Welcome to Week 3!</h1>
<p>I hope you all had a great weekend. I had a relaxing weekend at home. The state of Idaho, where I live, has implemented a phased plan
  to reopen the state. We entered phase 1 yesterday and many businesses were able to open with restrictions. We are feeling excited at my
  house because that means my husband has been able o return back to work! Woohoo! I'm still working from home and likely will be until
  mid June. Kinda crazy! With all this extra time at home I decided to try gardening. I started some seed starts last week and one of them
  started sprouting! Comment on this announcement and let me know how your weekend was! Include pictures if you took any.</p>

<p>Great work on your site plan assignments! Although we are all creating the same site, it was fun to see all of your different color schemes and font choices.
Each week I get more excited to see your final websites.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">As a reminder, you need to have passed last week's CSS quiz with 100% to be able to move on to this week.
  You can retake the quiz as many times as you need to get 100%. </p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">What to Expect This Week</h2>
<p>This week you will have another Khan Academy lesson and will learn about what it means to be a web designer.
  You will also be learning more about wireframes and how to troubleshoot your code.
  You will also have another activity this week to continue working on your white water rafting site.
  In this activity you are going to be writing the HTML for the home page by following the wireframe that was provided.
  There isn't as much guidance in the instructions as there was last week and you will be expected to write most of the HTML on your own.
  I know this sounds challenging but you are ready for it!</p>
<p>I want you to keep a few things in mind:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The assignment will make more sense if you refer to the wireframe while reading the instructions</li>
  <li>Your assignment will NOT look like the wireframe at the end of the assignment.
    If you watch the videos in the wireframing activity (please do) it shows a pretty good example of what your site will look like this week.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to complete the wireframing and troubleshooting activities. It's important you understand what is taught in those lessons.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="color: #993366;">Week 3 Walkthrough</h3>
<p>Below is a walkthrough of your week 3 assignments. Apologies, because it is a little long, but it goes into some details that will be helpful for you.
  At the end it also shows an example of what your week03 activity should look like at the end!</p>

<h2 style="color: #993366;">Getting Help and Feedback on Assignments</h2>
<h3 style="color: #993366;">Discussion Boards</h3>
<p>I have gone through the course and added a questions and conversations discussion board to every week of the course.
These discussion boards <b>are not required.</b> but can be used to ask and answer questions and even share things you've learned.
Please take some time to go through this board and see if you can help any of your peers who have asked questions.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Don't forget to include screenshots and code examples when asking for help.</p>
<p>If you post your website on this board, your peers can review it. If you post it by Thursday at 7 mountain time I will review it during office hours and give you some feedback.</p>
<h3 style="color: #993366;">Tutoring</h3>
<p>Tutoring is available for free through BYU-Idaho. If you are struggling with an assignment I recommend getting a tutor to help you.</p>
<p>You can visit this website to schedule a tutoring session:
  <a href="https://iplan.byui.edu/enterprise/login.html?redirectUrl=https%253A%252F%252Fiplan.byui.edu%252Fenterprise%252F"

<h3 style="color: #993366;">Ask me!</h3>
<p>If you don't feel comfortable posting your question to the discussion board or would rather talk to me directly, please, reach out!
  I am here to help you. I can't help you if you don't ask. You can reach me via email, messaging in canvas, call, text, and WhatsApp.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Please include screenshots and code examples when asking for help.
  I also need to know what specifically you're struggling with and what you have already tried.</p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">Office Hours</h2>
<p>I will hold office hours via zoom this Thursday at 7PM mountain time.
  Office hours will be recorded for anyone who canâ€™t attend and would like to watch later.
  Please come to office hours with questions in mind or work you would like to have reviewed.</p>

<h2 style="color: #993366;">Grading and Late Work</h2>
<p>I do my best to grade assignments within a timely manner. <i>Most of the time</i> I grade your work within a day of you turning it in.
  If you turn in your work early and get less than 100% I try to tell you how to improve your work and allow you to resubmit <strong>by the deadline</strong> for full points.
  So if you turn your work in a little early, you have an advantage! I have been grading assignments on Saturdays as they come in, but once quarantine is over I will likely not grade assignments on Saturdays.
</p>
<p>Late work is only worth 1/2 points so be sure to get your work in on time. <strong>That includes re-submitted work.</strong></p>
