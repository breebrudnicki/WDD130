<h1 style="color: #993366;">Welcome to Week 3!</h1>
<p>I hope you all had a great weekend. I had a relaxing weekend at home. The state of Idaho, where I live, has implemented a phased plan
  to reopen the state. We entered phase 1 yesterday and many businesses were able to open with restrictions. We are feeling excited at my
  house because that means my husband has been able o return back to work! Woohoo! I'm still working from home and likely will be until
  mid June. Kinda crazy! With all this extra time at home I decided to try gardening. I started some seed starts last week and one of them
  started sprouting! Comment on this announcement and let me know how your weekend was! Include pictures if you took any</p>

<p>Great work on your site plan assignments! Although we are all creating the same site, it was fun to see all of your different color schemes and font choices.
Each week I get more excited to see your final websites.</p>
<p>This week you are going to be writing the HTML for the home page of your white water rafting website by following the wireframe that was provided.
This week there isn't as much guidance in the instructions and you will be expected to write much of the HTML on your own. I know you can do it!</p>
