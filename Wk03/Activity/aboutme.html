        <h2>Sister Brudnicki</h2>

        <p>Hello and welcome to Web Fundamentals! I will be your instructor for this course. Hopefully you already saw a little bit
          about me in this weeks announcement. If you did, you know that I have a degree from
          BYU-Idaho in Web Design and Development (design emphasis). I took this exact class many years ago
          so getting the chance to teach it is exciting for me! Throughout this course you will be able to
          explore careers and see if Web Design is something you're interested in. There are many different
          career paths you can take with this degree. I chose to go into User Experience design and work as a
          UX designer at a credit union in Idaho. It is so rewarding.</p>

        <p>I have been married for three years and we don't have any kids. My husband and I
          like to get outdoors when its warm to hike and go stand-up paddle boarding. We also
          enjoy traveling! I personally enjoy doing crafts (I'm defiitely a DIY kind of person) and running. I'm hoping to run my first
          marathon this year, but a few of my races have already been cancelled due to COVID-19. So we'll see!
          Of course I also love designing and creating websites.</p>

        <p>There are so many advantages to having a career in web design. One thing that feels like a blessing
          right now is that I can work from home! My husband is currently out of work because of COVID-19
          but I am able to continue working from home. It's such a blessing.</p>

        <p>I was born into the church so I have been a member my whole life. That being said I have had my
          own experiences that have led to my personal conversion. I know this church is true and I'm so happy
          to be a part of it. One of my favorite quotes is from Jeffrey R. Holand because it gets me through
          hard times with hope and faith:</p>

        <blockquote>"If for a while the harder you try, the harder it gets, take heart.
          So it has been with the best people who ever lived."</blockquote>

        <p>We have all gone through hard times and many of you might be going through a hard time
          right now. Take heart and know you will make it through. I look forward to getting to
          know you throughout this course and seeing what you create. This is going to be a great semester!</p>
