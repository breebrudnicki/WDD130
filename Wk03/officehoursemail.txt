Quick reminder that tonight at 7PM mountain time I will be holding office hours. Please attend if you have questions or if you want your work reviewed. Many of you wait until Friday and Saturday before revealing that you need one on one help. If this is you, please attend office hours.

I will send out a recording for anyone who was unable to attend.
