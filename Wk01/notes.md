Before the Lesson Begins
- Students will have a reading quiz in the Intro Week, so make sure to send an e-mail to your students to have them complete the reading on the assessment and to complete the quiz.
- Canvas will probably be a new experience for many students. You may want to lead them through a quick tour of the course using Jing or a recorded Zoom session.
- Remind students to plan their time so that they can work consistently on the course throughout the week.
Many students are fresh out of high school; make the expectations and standards clear to the students.

Quiz results.  The students must score 100% on the HTML vocabulary quiz to move on to week 2. This is to encourage them to spend the time needed to really learn those terms. They can take it as many times as they need.  This will be the same next week as well with the CSS vocabulary quiz.
