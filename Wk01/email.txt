Hello!

Welcome to week 1. The course officially starts today! I hope you are as excited as I am. This week we are going to jump right in by learning HTML and creating your first webpage, which will be all about you!

I created a few videos for you to help you with this weeks assignments. To view them checkout the week 1 announcement I just posted.

Iâ€™m looking forward to getting to know you this week and seeing your very first web pages!
