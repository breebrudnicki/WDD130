<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Welcome to Week 1!</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are officially in week 1! I hope you are as excited as I am. This week we are going to jump right in by learning HTML and creating your first webpage, which will be all about you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I created a video to give you an overview of what we will be doing in week 1. You can watch it below or keep reading if you prefer to read the transcript. In the video I talk about the get to know you discussion board. One thing I forgot to mention is that you are required to respond to 5 other students. Please do not put this assignment off until the last minute so you have adequate time to get to know your peers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, you can always reach out to me for any help and assistance that you need through email, phone, text, and messaging in iLearn. I will get back to you within 24 hours except on Sundays.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you use large images in your get to know you assignment you might also want to watch this video which teaches you how to size them using HTML (transcript available below)</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Week 1 Overview Transcript</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week you have a few assignments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&rsquo;ll need to look over the syllabus. There is a syllabus quiz verifying that you have done this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also a course questions and conversations discussion board. Each week there will be a new questions discussion board. It is there for you to ask any questions that you have. You can also reach out to me directly with questions by calling, texting, emailing, messaging through iLearn, or commenting on announcements. Use whatever method works best for you. I check them all and am here to help you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first assignment you have is the software setup. Follow the directions carefully because you will need everything setup correctly for the next assignment. You will be creating an account with Glitch. It gives a few ways that you can create your account, I recommend creating a GitHub account and using that to create your Glitch account. If you choose to move forward with web design and development you will need a GitHub account so you might as well create one now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&rsquo;ve completed the software setup you can move on to the get to know you discussion board. Instead of writing a little post about yourself you will be creating a webpage about yourself! Pay close attention to the assignment and study the readings for this assignment. The HTML vocabulary quiz is on the things you learn in this assignment. You need to pass the quiz with 100% to move on to the next week so make sure you are understanding everything as you work through the activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last activity this semester is to watch a web fundamentals video. It&rsquo;s a 9/10 minute video and a transcript is available. This will give you an overview about the underlying technology for web development.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the activities are the quizzes that I already mentioned. The syllabus quiz to verify that you have read through the syllabus, and the HTML vocabulary quiz. There is also a self assessment quiz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to seeing the webpages you create this week!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Sizing Images in HTML Transcript</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are going through the activity this week and notice that your images are very large, there is a quick fix you can add to your image tag &lt;img&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will want to use the width attribute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On my image tag I added <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>width=&rdquo;200px&rdquo;</strong></span> to make it so my image was only 200 pixels wide. You can use whatever width you want though. Experiment to see what works for your image. Maybe 400 pixels will be better for your image!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a code example:</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lt;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">img </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">="</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image of me?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">src</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">="</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://cdn.glitch.com/e7d21069-86b1-4294-9067-59ab154d710e%2FIMG_5684.jpg?1545880129047</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">width=</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">200px</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">/&gt;</span></pre>
