<h1 style="color: #800080;">Welcome to Week 1!</h1>
<p>We are officially in week 1! I hope you are as excited as I am. This week we are going to jump right in by learning HTML and creating your first webpage, which will be all about you!</p>
<p>I created a video to give you an overview of what we will be doing in week 1. You can watch it below or keep reading if you prefer to read the transcript. In the video I talk about the get to know you discussion board. One thing I forgot to mention is that you are required to respond to 5 other students. Please do not put this assignment off until the last minute so you have adequate time to get to know your peers.</p>
<p>As a reminder, you can always reach out to me for any help and assistance that you need through email, phone, text, and messaging in iLearn. I will get back to you within 24 hours except on Sundays.</p>
