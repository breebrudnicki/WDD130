<h1 style="color: #993366;">Hello and Welcome to Week 2!</h1>
<p>I had so much fun getting to know all of you. It was fun to learn more about you, your hobbies, families, where you are from, and so much more. I hope you are all feeling very accomplished - many of you were able to
    create your very first web page last week! That is something to celebrate.</p>
<p>I have already started grading your get to know you discussion board posts. Most of you that got it done early should already have a grade. I will have everyone else's assignment graded by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>As a reminder, you need to have passed last week's HTML quiz with 100% to be able to move on to this week. You can retake the quiz as many times as you need to get 100%.</strong></p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">What to Expect This Week</h2>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/17fabcc069164b059814157e1a3e83e3" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
<p>This week you will have another reading assignment and a quiz. Just like last week, you will need to pass the quiz with 100% in order to move on to week 3. You can take it as many times as you need, but do it by the deadline or the late penalty will apply.</p>
<p>This week you will also be starting on your site plan for the fictitious white water rafting site. Planning is an essential step when creating a website. You will come up with the site colors and fonts as well as
    determine what the purpose of the site is and who the site is for. Some questions to ask yourself when working on this assignment are "Why does this company want a website?"" (purpose) and "Who will visit this website?"
    (audience).</p>
<p>This week there are not any required discussion boards. At the end of the week one of the quizes will ask if you participated in discussions. Because there is not a required discussion board, if you attend your gathering or chat with other students in this class, I am OK with you saying that you have participated in discussions. If niether of those things fit please consider participating in this weeks optional board.</p>
<h2 style="color: #993366;">What to do When You Have Questions / Need Help</h2>
<p>As you go through these assignments, you may have questions or need help with things. It's always great to ask your peers using the questions and conversations discussion board.
  When asking questions, be sure to include screenshots and code examples. Because of the nature of this class, it is hard to help
    without examples. You might also want to include some of the things that you have tried so far to fix your problem.</p>

<p>Teaching one another is an important part of the learning model. Check the questions and conversations board frequently. Ask questions there and answer your peers questions if you can! If you ask a question and are
    able to figure it out on your own, come back and post the solution so that others with the same question are able to find the answer.</p>
<p>Of course, reaching out to me individually is also an option. I can be reached via phone, text, email, whatsApp, and messaging within i-Learn. </p>
<h2 style="color: #800080;">Office Hours</h2>
<p>I will hold office hours via zoom this Thursday at 7PM mountain time.
  Office hours will be recorded for anyone who canâ€™t attend and would like to watch later.
  Please come to office hours with questions in mind or work you would like to have reviewed.
  The link to my zoom room can be found in the resources section of the course.
