<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #993366;">Hello and Welcome to Week 2! </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had so much fun getting to know all of you. It was fun to learn more about you, your hobbies, families, where you are from, and so much more. I hope you are all feeling very accomplished - many of you were able to create your very first web page last week! That is something to celebrate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have already started grading your get to know you discussion board posts. Most of you that got it done early should already have a grade. I will have everyone else&rsquo;s assignment graded by tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>As a reminder, you need to have passed last week's HTML quiz with 100% to be able to move on to this week. You can retake the quiz as many times as you need to get 100%.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>What to Expect This Week</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week you will have another reading assignment and a quiz. Just like last week, you will need to pass the quiz with 100% in order to move on to week 3. You can take it as many times as you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week you will also be starting on your site plan for the fictitious white water rafting site. Planning is an essential step when creating a website. You will come up with the site colors and fonts as well as determine what the purpose of the site is and who the site is for. Some questions to ask yourself when working on this assignment are &ldquo;Why does this company want a website?&rdquo; (purpose) and &ldquo;Who will visit this website?&rdquo; (audience).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>What to do When You Have Questions&nbsp; / Need Help</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you go through these assignments, you may have questions or need help with things. When asking questions, be sure to include screenshots and code examples. Because of the nature of this class, it is hard to help without examples. You might also want to include some of the things that you have tried so far to fix your problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, I am here to help you! I also want to encourage you to work with your peers when you need help.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching one another is an important part of the learning model. Check the questions and conversations board frequently. Ask questions there and answer your peers questions if you can! If you ask a question and are able to figure it out on your own, come back and post the solution so that others with the same question are able to find the answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, reaching out to me individually is also an option. I can be reached via phone, text, email, and messaging within i-Learn. I also recently got WhatsApp so that those of you who use that can reach me in that way too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993366; font-size: 18pt;">Office Hours</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will hold office hours via zoom this Thursday at 7PM mountain time. Office hours will be recorded for anyone who can&rsquo;t attend and would like to watch later. Office hours is a great way to get your questions answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of you have reached out asking me to review your assignment before you turn it in. Office hours is a great time to do that. If you won&rsquo;t be able to attend office hours in real time but would like your assignment reviewed please let me know and I will do so during office hours and send you the recording.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week during office hours I shared a cool tool that will allow you to see the HTML and CSS of ANY website! Here&rsquo;s a little video teaching you how to use that tool. I will update this announcement later today with a video transcript for those who are unable to watch it.</span></p>

<!--Extra announcement-->

<p>I hope you guys are having fun planning your white water rafting site! After speaking with a student, I noticed there is an error in the course code. If you want to change your paragraph text on white to a color other than black, you won't be able to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately as an instructor I am unable to fix the error - only course creators have the ability to do that. I'm submitting a course correction so that it does get fixed, but in the mean time, here is a little video teaching you how to make the fix yourself so that you can change your paragraph colors.</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.loom.com/embed/3249d2ab6a9f46bd8d415e8d79f75b05" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>If you are unable to watch the video, just know you will need to change line 59 of your code to:</p>
<p>color: var(--paragraph-color-on-white);</p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p>color: var(--paragraph-color);</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Extra Typography Help</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I also noticed that the instructions don't go into full detail about how to change the fonts. In step 10 of the assignment the instructions show you how to change the fonts in your import, but not on your webpage. Here's how to do it:</span></p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.loom.com/embed/098b16e721e14f058e86512896b7facc" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>If you are unable to watch the video, you will need to change the variables --heading-font and --paragraph-font on lines 14 and 15 to have your new font.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an example, I wanted to use montserrat for my paragraph so I changed the variable from:</p>
<p>--paragraph-font: Lato, Helvetica, sans-serif;</p>
<p>to :</p>
<p>--paragraph-font: Montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif;</p>
