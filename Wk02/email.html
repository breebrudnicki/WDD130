Welcome to week 2!

This weeks assignment is going to be super fun but also challenging for many of you. I recommend that you get started on it early so that if you struggle you can get help during office hours. I created a video going through the assignment to help you out.

If you can't make it to office hours and are struggling a lot please utilize the tutoring center. There is information about getting a tutor in the resources section of this course.

With that, I am excited to see your work this week! It really is a fun assignment so please, have fun with it! Also be sure to check out the announcement I posted this week that gives more information on what to expect this week.
