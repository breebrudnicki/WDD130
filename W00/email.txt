Welcome to Web Fundamentals!

My name is Sister Brudnicki, and I will be your instructor this semester. I am looking forward to getting to know you and working with you as we create websites!

Because this is a 2 credit class, you are expected to spend an average of 4-6 hours to complete course work each week. The semester will begin on [insert date], but you are invited to view the course now to familiarize yourself with it. Be sure to check out the announcement I posted in I-Learn to learn more about this classes structure and what to expect!

You can access the course by logging into I-Learn (canvas) and selecting our class. Please read the course syllabus for more information about the course and assignments. Then open and begin the first lesson. Remember, this is not an independent study course, so you will need to follow the due dates posted online.

Each week, I will hold an office hour on [insert day of week and time, including time zone]. I highly recommend that you attend the session and bring your questions. You can find a link to my virtual office (zoom room) in the resources section of the course. During office hours time, I will be available to answer any questions you might have and discuss the current assignments.

I hope each of you know that even though this course is online, I am available to answer your questions and concerns. I am available through email, phone, text, whatsApp, and messaging in I-Learn (my personal favorite). Please feel free to reach me in the way that works best for you. I will respond within 24 hours except on Sundays.

I am looking forward to our time together this semester. Remember to use appropriate etiquette and respectful communication with me and with your classmates throughout the semester.
