<h1 style="color: #800080;">Welcome to Web Fundamentals! I'm Sister Brudnicki.</h1>

<p>I'm excited to start this course with you and get to know you as the semester progresses.</p>
<h2 style="color: #800080;">What You Can Expect This Semester</h2>
<p>Each week we will have a questions and conversations discussion board. This is a great place to ask questions and help your peers.</p>
<p>If you need to reach out to me, please do so! I am here to help you.
Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns at any point in the semester. I'm here to help you! You can reach me through text, phone, email, whatsApp or even the conversations tool in iLearn. Please do not try to contact me on facebook, I will not respond and I do not add students on facebook during the semester. If you would like to connect after the semester is over I would be happy to!</p>
<p>I will also make myself avaiable each week for office hours. If you are unable to attend office hours because of a conflict or are in a drastically different time zone, that is ok! For those students I recommend utilizing the tutoring center. There is more information about the tutoring center in the resources section of the class.</p>
<p>You should also be aware of the late work policy. Late work is penalized at a 50% reduction, so be sure to get your work in on time! I always have assignments graded within a week of the due date, usually sooner! Many times I will grade assignments early and give you a chance to earn full points if you missed points on anything. However, your work has to be in on time for me to allow this.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about how this course is structured and how to be successful in this course, I recommend you watch this quick video:</p>

<h2 style="color: #800080;" >A little about me</h2>
<p>I have a degree in <strong style="color: #800080;">Web Design and Development</strong> (design emphasis) from BYU-I and have put that degree to use working as a User Experience designer. When I first arrived at BYU-Idaho as an 18-year-old freshman, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I ended up taking a career exploration class that led me to try out web design, which was something I had never considered. The next semester I took this class (which was only a one credit class at the time) and fell in love! It was the first time I had ever been exposed to code. If this is your first time learning about creating websites, I'm right here with you. I know exactly how that feels.</p>
<p>I'm originally from Oregon, but I'm currently living in Pocatello, Idaho. Someday I would love to get back to the Pacific Northwest, but right now I'm perfectly happy in my Idahome!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer is my favorite season in Idaho. I like to get out and run. I&rsquo;ve run a few half marathons and plan to run my first full marathon this fall! I also enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and stand-up paddle boarding with my husband.</span></p>
<!--Change paragraph below as times change. :)-->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since my husband and I have been married we've been able to travel. Last year we went on a Cruise and visited a few countries (here's a picture of us in Mexico!). This summer we were looking forward to going to Thailand but recently cancelled our trip because of all of this COVID-19 craziness. We plan to make it there another time.</span></p>

<p>Whether you're in the boat I was (<em style="color: #800080;">zero code experience!</em>) or know a lot, let me tell you, this is going to be a fun 14 weeks together! Throughout this course you will be creating 2 websites. Creation for both of the websites will be broken up throughout each week so you can focus on one thing at a time and build as you learn. Because each week builds on the other it&rsquo;s very important that you turn assignments in on-time so that I can give you feedback that will help you on the next week's assignment in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Everyone will be creating the same website for your first website. This will help you focus on the foundational principles you&rsquo;re learning. The second website will be whatever you want it to be, so be thinking about what you will want your website to be about.</span></p>
<p>Throughout this course I know you will develop a love for learning. One of the things I love most about this field is that because technology is constantly changing, we have the opportunity to always learn.</span></p>
<p>I can't wait to get to know YOU in this week's get to know you discussion board. You'll be able to post a little bit about yourself and get to know some of your fellow classmates. We're going to be diving right in this week so you'll also be learning about HTML this week. Head to week 1 to get started!</span></p>
