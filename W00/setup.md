#Setup for the Semester

##Discussion Boards

Include a Questions and Conversations (optional) discussion board for every week. Starting out there is only a board for week on. Include the following text:

This discussion board is for student to student interactions in posting questions or ideas  about this weekâ€™s assignments or content. Take advantage of this time to teach one another by asking your own questions and answering your peers' questions.

Feel free to post your assignment for this week if you would like feedback. Post by Thursday 7PM mountain time to have it reviewed during office hours.

If you're struggling with code, please include code examples and screenshots.
